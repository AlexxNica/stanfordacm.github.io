    <span>Hulu Software Engineer – CS '09</span>
    <p>Given a discrete probability distribution, one can sample from it quickly using standard algorithms such as the alias method (Walker 1977). However, these algorithms assume the distribution does not change between samples, that is, the sampling is done with replacement. We present an efficient algorithm for sampling from a discrete probability distribution without replacement and its application at Hulu.</p>

    <span>Senior Data Engineer, Groupon</span>
    <p>Big data at human scale.  With "Big Data" all the rage these days, it's easy to overlook the fact that much of that data are inaccurate, incomplete, or duplicated.  Humans excel and finding and correcting these errors, but do not easily scale. At Groupon, we're building tools and systems that seamlessly and efficiently blend human input into data processing, yielding high-quality data at large scale.</p>
