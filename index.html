    <span>Hulu Software Engineer – CS '09</span>
    <p>Given a discrete probability distribution, one can sample from it quickly using standard algorithms such as the alias method (Walker 1977). However, these algorithms assume the distribution does not change between samples, that is, the sampling is done with replacement. We present an efficient algorithm for sampling from a discrete probability distribution without replacement and its application at Hulu.</p>

    <span>Stanford CS '14</span>
    <p>Optimizing Hash Aggregation to Best Utilize the CPU - In my summer working on Cloudera Impala, I was tasked with finding the optimal hash aggregation algorithm. The naive implementation of this operation has an essentially random memory access pattern and thus slows down dramatically when the size of the hash table exceeds the size of processor cache. This talk will discuss the challenges and strategies for optimizing algorithms to best take advantage of modern CPU's and how this applies to the problem of hash aggregation.</p>

    <span>Founder Prismatic</span>
   <p>Prismatic delivers realtime newsfeeds for thousands of learned topics based on your interests and social networks. The Prismatic backend requires many custom abstractions, sophisticated machine learning techniques, data crawling, and graph analysis algorithms. We discuss how our small backend team (just four engineers) built this stack in record time using a unique design philosophy facilitated by Clojure. In a nutshell, our problem-solving approach prefers lightweight composable custom abstractions for problems rather than monolithic open-source frameworks (e.g., Hadoop).</p>

    <p>At Ness Computing, our mission is to make recommendations personal.  Ness’ first product is a mobile restaurant recommendation product.  In order to provide such a service, and provide a more relevant experience for users, there are a number of concrete sub-problems that must be solved, which will be discussed.  The first is Canonicalization, taking many different data sources to create a single set of golden data that is robust to noise, and cleaner than any of the individual datasets.  The second is the use of Collaborative Filtering to provide personalized scores for how much a user will like one location versus another.  The third is more intelligent recommendations, using the personalized score, along with other signals like time of day to suggest restaurants a user is likely to enjoy.</p>
