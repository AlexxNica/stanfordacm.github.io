    <p>Given a discrete probability distribution, one can sample from it quickly using standard algorithms such as the alias method (Walker 1977). However, these algorithms assume the distribution does not change between samples, that is, the sampling is done with replacement. We present an efficient algorithm for sampling from a discrete probability distribution without replacement and its application at Hulu.</p>
