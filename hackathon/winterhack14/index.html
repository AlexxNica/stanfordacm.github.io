    Influx is an abstracted platform for building data analysis pipelines. Users

    connecting elements in an intuitive flowchart. Instead of having decentralized
    directories of scripts that are difficult to maintain, Influx allows companies
    to build their data analysis into a single-cohesive platform, with real-time
    collaboration and an accessible web-based interface.
