# Stanford ACM Hackathon #2 - Fall 2011 Results

It was a blast! There were a total of 44 teams of up to 4 registered. Over 12 hours of extreme hacking, some pretty sweet projects were developed.

### In case you missed the Stanford Hack Competition, here's a summary of all the hacks.

## The rules were:

- 12 hours to code.
- No previously written code allowed (except for common libraries and stuff).
- Judged based on innovativeness, technical difficulty, and usefulness, in that order.

## The winners:

**WireSheep** – 1st place - Feross Aboukhadijeh & John Hiesey & Daniel Posch & Nikil Viswanathan

WireSheep lets you sniff packets on an open WiFi network. Instead of just stealing login cookies, like Firesheep, it lets you see traffic in realtime, like Wireshark. FireShark shows you each user on the network and all the HTTP requests they’re making. Check out the code: [Github](https://github.com/feross/WireSheep)

**Digital Steganography** – 2nd place

The ability to encode and decode images and messages into images. Great use of cryptography.

**Community Crate** – 3rd place - Karthik Viswanathan & Evan Shieh & Ayush Sood

The missing link between Facebook and Dropbox. Send large files to your friends.

## The rest of the hacks:

**Music in Motion**

Sync computers and mobile devices to play the same song. Pick a song on the server and broadcast to all the nodes and watch them play the same thing.

**Snail Mail Sensor**

Used one of our sponsors’ technology – GreenGoose – to detect when the mail arrives in a mailbox.

**Mob Beat**

Allows you to send playlists to friends and decide playlists over bluetooth.

**LetzEat**

Allows a group to decide where to eat based on the preferences of the members.

**SuperGoose**

Allowed you to get cumulative data about how active you are. Provides notifications on when to exercise. Used GreenGoose technology to sense exercise regimens.

**Haiku Generator**

Android app that randomly generates a Haiku.

**Book Pimp**

Online store for textbook selling on campus.

**Chinny Chin Chin**

C# game. The Chinchillas need your help getting across the screen!

**xCare**

Used GreenGoose technology to monitor behavior and motivation. Graph’s progress of different tasks.

**GreenGoose House**

Full fledge security system using GreenGoose technology. Includes floor plans of rooms and uses sensors to detect movement, tilt, etc.

## Thanks to:

- The ACM-ers and SVI Hackspace people who helped organize this.
- The judges.
- Our sponsors (Facebook, Microsoft, Ness, Qualcomm, GreenGoose, Boeing, & Stanford Computer Forum).

This hack competition went really well, so we're planning to do this again! Start planning your hacks!
