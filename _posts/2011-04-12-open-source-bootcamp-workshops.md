<strong>Workshops</strong>

Be sure to let us know if you have any questions - we'll have a Facebook page up once you are assigned to a workshop so you can ask any questions you have about preparing your workspace or the workshops in general.

<strong>Scaling a Web Application, Jeff Balogh</strong>

We'll take a naïvely built web app and turn it into something that can handle millions of users. Initial code will be provided and we'll evolve the design into something that scales using Amazon's EC2 for deployment and load testing.  We'll be working on a webapp with Python and Django. Experience helps but isn't necessary. The code is simple.

<em>Requirements:</em>
<ul>
	<li><em>You'll need git if you want to check out the code locally.
</em></li>
	<li><em>Cloud servers with everything loaded up will be provided, so you should be comfortable working the command line if you want to write code.
</em></li>
	<li><em>Writing code is optional.
</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Frontend Development Foundations, Matthew Claypotch</strong>

Every great web site needs a public face. Structuring your pages correctly will win you points in accessibility and maintainability, and win you points with search engines, In this session, we'll turn your resume from a PDF to a Pretty Dang Fine webpage. Learn to appreciate beautiful (and semantic!) HTML, classy CSS, and a splash of JavaScript.

<strong>Web Security, Hands on Learning, Michael Coates</strong>

The web is a dangerous place with talented criminals looking to destroy the apps that you spent so much time and effort creating. This workshop will be a hands on learning experience covering current threats to web applications. We'll use a vulnerable test application and perform hands on testing to understand these attacks and how to properly defend against them in our applications.

<em>Note: Students can listen and follow along to Michael’s presentation or they can participate in hands-on learning on their own workstations while Michael works through some exercises.  Issues are discussed at both a high level to cover overall impacts and also a detailed technical level for those interested.</em>

<em>Requirements for hands-on exercises:</em>
<ul>
	<li><em>Windows or Mac OS</em></li>
	<li><em>Download <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMware player</a> (free for Windows/Linux, vmfusion is available for mac but not free)</em></li>
