    <p>Reimagining Windows: Low-level changes in Windows 8</p>
    <p><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Windows development team set out to “reimagine” the OS for Windows 8. Much of the recent press has focused on the most visible result of this process – a new touch-friendly user interface. Eric’s talk will focus on some of the less-visible but equally important innovations that have been made at the lower levels of the OS. Eric Traut (’93 BS CSE) oversees the development of the core components in the Windows operating system including the kernel, virtualization, storage and security.</small></p>

But the proliferation of inexpensive and ubiquitous multimedia devices is changing our world even more. The last time I checked Flickr has hundreds of thousands of pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge --- That's more than one a foot.    I'd like to address the three questions and opportunities presented by multimedia: Does content matter?  Is it information or entertainment?  And just what is a tag?  I'll talk about the issue, the opportunity and some of the algorithic solutions that are possible.  But there is much work to be done.</small></p>

    <p>Given a discrete probability distribution, one can sample from it quickly using standard algorithms such as the alias method (Walker 1977). However, these algorithms assume the distribution does not change between samples, that is, the sampling is done with replacement. We present an efficient algorithm for sampling from a discrete probability distribution without replacement and its application at Hulu.</p>

    <p>Optimizing Hash Aggregation to Best Utilize the CPU - In my summer working on Cloudera Impala, I was tasked with finding the optimal hash aggregation algorithm. The naive implementation of this operation has an essentially random memory access pattern and thus slows down dramatically when the size of the hash table exceeds the size of processor cache. This talk will discuss the challenges and strategies for optimizing algorithms to best take advantage of modern CPU's and how this applies to the problem of hash aggregation.</p>

The Prismatic backend requires many custom abstractions, sophisticated machine learning techniques, data crawling, and graph analysis algorithms. We discuss how our small backend team (just four engineers) built this stack in record time using a unique design philosophy facilitated by Clojure. In a nutshell, our problem-solving approach prefers lightweight composable custom abstractions for problems rather than monolithic open-source frameworks (e.g., Hadoop).</p>

In order to provide such a service, and provide a more relevant experience for users, there are a number of concrete sub-problems that must be solved, which will be discussed.  The first is Canonicalization, taking many different data sources to create a single set of golden data that is robust to noise, and cleaner than any of the individual datasets.  The second is the use of Collaborative Filtering to provide personalized scores for how much a user will like one location versus another.  The third is more intelligent recommendations, using the personalized score, along with other signals like time of day to suggest restaurants a user is likely to enjoy.</p>

pages by "machine reading" them, to make the information usable for
aggregation, indexing, mashups, and automatic analysis. We'll talk
about the machine learning tasks that Diffbot uses to extract
information, and the stages of that processing, from HTML rendering to
machine vision to NLP, and give an overview of the challenges in
building a system able to interpret real-world web data, which require
robust engineering as well as a combination of diverse approaches from
NLP, the RDF/semweb community, and design semantics.  Along the way,
we'll demo some behind-the-scenes components of the technology and
